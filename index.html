            <p>I have a new thought on this second web page. My goal is to make it so people
              who I am connected with can post articles and discussions on this page. The
              idea would be like a reddit hosted by myself. It is more important to me that
              the contributors were born in the 80's and Iowa has influenced their life
              in some substantial way. The proximity to myself is less critical</p>
            <p>To that end, I will need to set this webpage up so people can request a login.
              That login will need to go through an approval process. Once approved, people
              can post on any topic they choose. They can also create their own topics</p>
            <p>This brings me to the next things I will need to create, a beginning list of
              topics along with the ability to create additional topics. Should be a fun
              endeavor and expand my skills!</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>After a little over four months using the pro version of the
            app <em>Mimo</em>, I am here. I have done all the courses and projects
            within the web development path, and I am now doing a courses
            on web page development.</p>
            <p>The humorous part of all this to me is I actually published
            my first webpage using <a href="https://mjowens.com">Wordpress.com
            </a> this month as well. Where I previously had 0 web pages and
            actively sought to downplay my use of social media. I now have
            done the following:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Reactivated my Twitter account</li>
             <li>Updated facebook photos and the link</li>
             <li>Overhauled my LinkedIn page</li>
             <li>Created a Flicker page</li>
             <li>Created my first webpage using Wordpress.com</li>
             <li>Actually put my Mimo learning into use with this page</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What is the <strong><em>endgame</em></strong> of all this?
            It is a little vague, but the short of it is sharing more about
            myself, and find a way to earn some money off of it all in the
            future.</p>
